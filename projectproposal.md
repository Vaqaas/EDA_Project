# Proposal for NYC Street Artists' Association

Hi,

My name is Syed Vaqaas Aslam. I am a data scientist, and I would like to introduce my services to your organization. I present to you an analysis using subway data from the Metropolitan Transit Authority. I'll show that using even the most basic of exploratory data analysis, we can pinpoint the locations of the highest foot traffic at numerous subway stops at varying times of day. The information provided will give you the proper location where the largest audience is available at your chosen time of performance. If you find this information useful, please enlist my servise so we can further collaboration and use more advanced tools to unlock insights that will increase the overall enrichment of the New York City populace.
