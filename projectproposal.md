# Proposal for NYC Street Artists' Association

Hi,

My name is Syed Vaqaas Aslam. I am a data scientist, and I would like to introduce my services to your organization. 

A question you may ask yourself is when and where you can set up your performance spot to achieve the largest audience. I present to you an analysis that can answer that question using subway data from the Metropolitan Transit Authority. I'll show that using even the most basic of exploratory data analysis, we can pinpoint the locations of the highest foot traffic at numerous subway stops at varying times of day. The information provided will give you the proper location where the largest audience is available at your chosen time of performance. If you find this information useful, please enlist my service so we can further our collaboration and use more advanced tools to unlock insights that will increase the overall enrichment of the New York City populace.
