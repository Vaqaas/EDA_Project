# Proposal for NYC Street Artists' Association

Hi,

My name is Syed Vaqaas Aslam. I am a data scientist, and I would like to introduce my services to your organization. 

A question you may ask yourself is when and where you can set up your performance spot to achieve the largest audience. I present to you an analysis that can answer that question using subway data from the Metropolitan Transit Authority. I'll show that using even the most basic of exploratory data analysis, we can pinpoint the locations of the highest foot traffic at numerous subway stops at varying times of day. The information provided will give you the proper location where the largest audience is available at your chosen time of performance. 

The data I am using will be downloaded from the [MTA Turnstile Data Webpage](http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html). Further manipulation and processing of this data will be done using SQLite, Python, and Python's various numerical packages like numpy and matplotlib. Although the data used provides data beyond time and place, the features such as stop location, date, time, and whether the train was scheduled to stop or was a recovery stop (REGULAR or RECOVERAUD) will be most useful in planning performances.

If you find this information useful, please enlist my service so we can further our collaboration and use more advanced tools to unlock insights that will increase the overall enrichment of the New York City populace.
